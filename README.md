## Installation
You can install _pyCellPhenoX_ from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install pyCellPhenoX
```

**conda** ([link](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyCellPhenoX)):
``` bash 
# install pyCellPhenoX from conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge pyCellPhenoX
```

**github** ([link](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/pyCellPhenoX)):
``` bash
# install pyCellPhenoX directly from github
git clone git@github.com:fanzhanglab/pyCellPhenoX.git
```

### Dependencies/ Requirements
When using pyCellPhenoX please ensure you are using the following dependency versions or requirements
``` python 
python = "^3.9"
pandas = "^2.2.3"
numpy = "^2.1.1"
xgboost = "^2.0"
numba = ">=0.54"
shap = "^0.46.0"
scikit-learn = "^1.5.2"

```

## Tutorials
Please see the [Command-line Reference] for details. Additonally, please see [Walkthroughs] on the documentation page. 

## API
pyCellPhenoX has four major functions which are apart of the object:
1. split_data() - Split the data into training, testing, and validation sets 
2. model_train_shap_values() - Train the model using nested cross validation strategy and generate shap values for each fold/CV repeat
3. get_shap_values() - Aggregate SHAP values for each sample
4. get_intepretable_score() - Calculate the interpretable score based on SHAP values. 

Additional major functions associated with pyCellPhenoX are:
1. marker_discovery() - Identify markers correlated with the discriminatory power of the Interpretable Score.
2. nonNegativeMatrixFactorization() - Perform non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
3. preprocessing() - Prepare the data to be in the correct format for CellPhenoX
4. principleComponentAnalysis() - Perform Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

Each function has uniqure arguments, see our [documentation] for more information
